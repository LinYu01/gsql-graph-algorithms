/*
 Compute the pageRank score for each vertex in the GRAPH, given a set of source vertices
 In each iteration, compute a score for activated vertices if they are source vertices:
   score = (1-damping) + damping*sum(received scores FROM its neighbors).
 If they are not source vertices, then score = damping*sum(received scores FROM its neighbors).
 The personalized pageRank algorithm stops when either of the following is true:
  a) it reaches max_iter iterations;
  b) the max score change for any vertex compared to the last iteration <= maxChange.
  
Parameters:
 v_type: vertex types to traverse          print_accum: print JSON output
 e_type: edge types to traverse            result_attr: INT attr to store results to
 max_iter; max #iterations                 file_path: file to write CSV output to
 top_k: #top scores to output              display_edges: output edges for visualization
 max_change: max allowed change between iterations to achieve convergence
 damping: importance of traversal vs. random teleport

 This query supports only taking in a single edge for the time being (8/13/2020).
